        "The marbles example does not use priors, because any outside knowledge you have about marbles would not help you make a prediction, besides knowing the color composition of marbles in the bag. In the free throw example, having a prior would help you make a more accurate guess about his free throw percentage (ie. knowing how he plays in the NBA, etc.). For similarities, both examples require you to make guesses about the probability."
